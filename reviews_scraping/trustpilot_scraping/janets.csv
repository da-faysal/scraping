GB,3,"I have just completed the Diploma in Motorbike Mechanics, overall, I enjoyed it and its good value for money, however, it really does depend on why you are doing this course as to how good it is.  If you are a mechanic doing this for your CPD records or a trainee mechanic who is already established in a garage, then I would give it a higher rating. For me, it was fit for purpose, as I only wanted to learn the basics to do basic fixes myself.  However if you are a wanting to complete this course and be ready to start a trainee position in a garage then I'd go elsewhere, many mechanical terms are not explained (I had to look them up online) and it would be much more useful to have diagrams of the subject matter you are reading about on the page rather than a photo of a random bike! For example, the section about different components of an engine, having a diagram of this would have been so helpful rather than a photo of the outside of a bike engine.  On a side note, the electronic voice-over was so distracting - it went straight off!!  That being said, I'm glad I undertook the course with Janets, great support available, student dashboard easy to navigate with lots of information.",2021-05-22T17:25:03+00:00,"Enjoyable - Good value for money, however....",Michelle RobsonMacquarrie

GB,1,Where to begin with this mess? Well how about the fact the courses themselves aren't great as A: they are out of date and B: a poorly put together mish mash of multiple existing courses from across the internet. There are no tests or any other means of reviewing your learning as the courses from my experience are just videos. The worst part is I have not received the free certificate that is supposed to be awarded upon completion of the course and there is no response from their support team if there even is one.,2021-02-03T20:59:50+00:00,Scam that should be avoided at all costs!,M ALEXANDER
GB,1,"Copying and pasting random phrases from different websites which make no sense to the context. Bad spelling and grammatical errors, repeated paragraphs with nothing new and informative to divulge in. Probably written by a wannabe blogger from the all ‘in my experience’ where no examples were mentioned whether it be a task asked by client, pricing of any sort or anything you wouldn't already know. Too much use of American association terminology and ‘state by state laws’ when this is meant to be a UK based course with the throw away £ sign here and there. Poor course with zero value. Not even worthy of 1 star. You get more of design insight from a teenager on tiktok decorating their room.

I have made an enquiry with the London college of professional studies and have shown them the pdf version of the ICT diploma and transcript completed and they have said that I can use this certificate to start an OTHM Level 4 Diploma in information technology.  And the next day after I have completed my final exam for the diploma through Janet's I have completed the CompTia A+ Certification course provided by Janet's and have scored 88/100 also with absolutely no revision whatsoever.

When i tried to place a review on the course i was informed that the reviews were disabled with the course. Why disable the review???does not make sense. If i were to describe the course it could be dramatically improved with the different points.  a few more pictures to show the point or what part of the car it was referring to would make things better and much clearer for the student. In summary the course is very broad, good as a introduction only. The course should be renamed Car Maintenance Course -> An introduction.

Not to mention the orthography errors in the mock exam. Recently I decided to start another course I've bought and I noticed that there was just 2 moths left... Each course is self paced 1 year, all of them are sold individually, so if I just started one why all 5 started counting?

Prompt email reply and live chat awesome and simply awesome. Third-course content and videos of the lessons properly organised, structured and adequate time. It’s worth studying. I did so many online courses but till now no one match Janets. Moreover there student ID card well recognised by the industry. Amount of discount you will get basically it’s free education.

PS,1,It's a scam.I do not recommend buying it. This course is a waste of money. You can find the same information online for free and on youtube.

GB,1,"I have just completed a Xero accounting software course and the only way to describe it was terrible. For a start, the course was based on the software back as far as 2017. Immediately its outdated as there have been several updates since then. Secondly, the person providing the course did not have a clue! She spent a lot of time looking through tabs to find where to find information relating to the task and even put in incorrect information from the print off provided. This had a knock on as I went through the course as she had to keep correcting her mistakes. The information given only related to anyone who didn't use the bank/credit card feeds which probably relates to very few people. To top it all, at the end of the course which took a couple of days of my life which I will never get back, they ask for payment for the certificate. All in all, pathetic.",2020-07-03T16:26:07+00:00,Xero Accounting Sotware - dont even bother…,Angela

GB,4,"The course I have completed in Advance Diploma in Office Administration has been great! There is a lot of valuable information provided in the form of handouts and I like the fact that the material can be viewed in full screen mode, presentation mode, or as small print handouts. The site itself is very easy to manoeuvre around- it is user friendly. There are videos also added to each module. The course can also be completed on your mobile phone which is also very handy! I found the information to do with Word, Powerpoint and Excel very useful to put into practice with all the documents I need to produce for work purposes. I learnt a lot of things that I didn't know before and I am happy I can put this qualification on my CV and it should help my job prospects a great deal now! Thank you Ronnie at the helpdesk so much for the quick responses to my emails whenever I had any issues.
